##### Hi, welcome to my GitHub. 
Here you will find most of the projects I have and is working on. 
## About Me
Studied Computer Science at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science & Technology.
I'm very focused and love a challenge. I believe in what a lot of people say - that life is what you make it. So I'm trying to see if my actions and decisions will create my life for real. In the end if they don't, at least I will know there's something more to it than efforts, actions and decisions. I love to think, especially, about my thoughts.
